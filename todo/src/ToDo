1. Need an input field with a button to submit (AddTodo)
2. A list that renders the todo items (TodoList)
3. A filter that shows the items accordingly (Filter)

State and Actions

1. No state since data doesn't change based on input
The action is to be allowed to add items

2. One state is for displaying an array of items, 
One state is for endering out accordingly to the filter
The action is to display wheter an item is completed or not(ToggleCompleted)

3. One state for rendering acoordingly to the currently set filter
The action is to click a link to display other links

Reducers

Each action needs a corresponding reducer. Put the reducer logic into container 
components to keep presentational components clean

1. Define the shape of State
2. Handle Actions

The state has to be extended by an item when the addTodo action is called
The staate has to be reorganized when the filter action is called

Store and Dispatching

1. Displaying the list requires the container of TodoList to define a function
that filters the items according to the filter variable

Return that function in mapStateToProps to transform redux state into Props.

Dispatch the action like toggleTodo with mapDispatchToPrps

the container will be created with connect, connecting the passed props to 
the presentational component

2. Create AddToDoForm as container needs the same steps for reading
Redux state and dispatching an onSubmit function

3. The filter component needs the same steps for reading Redux state and dispatching
an onClick function
